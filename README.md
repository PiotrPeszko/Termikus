TERMIKUS is an alternative thermostat firmware for Sonoff TH hardware or other ESP8266 based platforms, like Wemos or Adafruit. It converts Sonoff TH to standalone thermostatic device with web and API interfaces. TERMIKUS has implemented REST API, so integration with inteligent home hubs is possible.
